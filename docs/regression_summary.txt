# possible obstacles with regressions
# 1) non-linearity of features
# - plotting the residuals of the model can identify if there is a pattern
# - if residuals are not randomized, most likely some tranformation needs to occur
# - for example if we see an exponential convex shape in residuals, would make sense to square features
# 2) correlation of error terms
# - discovery is same as above
# 3) non-constant variation of the error terms
# - we can identify heteroskedasticity through a funnel shape in residual plots
# - represents the error terms have non-constant variance
# - solution would be to transform reponse by concave function (log or square root)
# 4) collinearity
# - when multiple features are very correlated
# - we can drop a variable or possibly combine the variables
# 5) outliers
# - can drop outliers, but also can be crucial to include them due to data lost

NOTE: that collinearity and heteroskedasticity dont really matter if aim is just prediction
